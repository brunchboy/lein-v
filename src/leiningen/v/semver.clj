;;; This implementation of lein-v versioning protocols supports incrementable versions for
;;; major, minor & patch as well as incrementable arbitrary qualifiers.  It also supports
;;; arbitrary string metadata.  It does not support SNAPSHOT qualifiers due to semver's insistence
;;; (section 3) on never releasing different artifacts with the same version.  There is also no
;;; support for build distance versions.  Such support would have required appropriating the patch
;;; element to represent distance (which may be a reasonable alternate implementation).
;;; http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html
;;; Example Versions & Interpretations:
;;; 1.2.3-rc.4+Xabcd => major 1, minor 2, patch 3, qualifier rc incremented to 4 & metadata Xabcd
